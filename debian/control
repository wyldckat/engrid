Description: open-source mesh generation
 ENGRID is an open-source mesh generation software with CFD applications in
 mind. ENGRID uses the NETGEN library for tetrahedral grid generation and an
 in-house development for prismatic boundary layer grids. Internally, ENGRID
 uses the VTK data structures as well as the *.vtu file format. To create
 grids for OPENFOAM® (OPENFOAM® is a registered trade mark of OpenCFD Limited),
 the GMSH format can be used. GMSH is also an excellent open-source tool to
 create surface triangulations for ENGRID.
 ENGRID is released under the GPL and we hope that it is a useful addition to
 the open-source CFD community. So far the implemented algorithm proved to be
 quite robust and it does not require much user interaction.
 The development of ENGRID has been funded by the European Space Agency
